# ProjectMod

ProjectMod is a Minecraft mod developed by Gabriela Marek, Gabriela Wanat, and Micha≈Ç Wojnar. It adds various new blocks, items, and features to enhance the gameplay experience. Utilizing the flexibility and extensibility of Forge, we've implemented various custom blocks, items, and mechanics to provide players with fresh challenges and adventures. Through careful design and meticulous attention to detail, we've ensured that every addition to the game feels cohesive and immersive, enhancing the overall enjoyment of Minecraft gameplay.

Our mod features a diverse array of content, from rare ores like Fire Ore and Glacier Ore to powerful weapons like the legendary MIECZ sword. Players can explore new biomes, craft advanced equipment, and embark on epic quests using the unique items and tools provided by ProjectMod.

Technologically, ProjectMod is built using Java, the primary language for Minecraft mod development. We leverage the capabilities of Gradle as our build automation tool, simplifying the development and deployment process. Additionally, we make extensive use of Forge's APIs and libraries to interact with Minecraft's codebase, enabling us to seamlessly integrate our custom content into the game.
